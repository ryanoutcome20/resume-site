                Hi, I'm Ryan, a Software Engineer specializing in reverse engineering, game development, and cybersecurity. 
                I work on open-source tools that push the boundaries of game modding and secure software development.

                Most of my projects range from reverse engineering efforts, game development, and cybersecurity although 
                I sometimes choose to dabble in networking or <span class="gradient-text">web development</span>.

            <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Reading:</h5>

            <p>
                I'm passionate about reading, especially Biblical studies, programming theory, and historical non-fiction. 
                Various books I'm currently working on include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/kjv-holy-bible-thomas-nelson/1144322613">

            <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Programming:</h5>

            <p>
                Apart from being my full-time job, I enjoy spending time expanding my coding skills, 
                exploring new languages and frameworks, and working on personal projects.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once completed, you'll be able to check out some of the more hypothetical or practical
                work I post on my blog, including but not limited to exploits, write-ups, and more.

            <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Other:</h5>

            <p>
                Outside the digital world, I appreciate time outdoors, particularly hunting, 
                and I take a technical interest in firearms, including their mechanics, calibers, 
                and historical significance.
